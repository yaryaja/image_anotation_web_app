# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Image_annotator_app using  MERN stack to upload and retrieve images

------------

Nowadays basic CRUD functionality is used in basically every application on the web. Most know how easy it is to store basic data types in databases, but with the more apps I have built the more I have seen how prevalent media types are in database storage and how most apps could put use to them. So let's look at how we can store a single image or multiple images in a database and then retrieve them to display.

## Technologies

- React
- Node
- Express
- Multer
- Mongoose
- MongoDB Atlas

We will build a basic React front end with a file picker as our interface to post to the backend. For the backend we will use Node with express to create an API that will interact with MongoDB's new database as a service Atlas, to store our images.

## Setting up MongoDB

In the server/index.js replace with your connecton string to set up mongodb database.

## let install all the dependencies
`npm i`
## Front End 

Let's quickly get our front end up and running using  and 
 `npm start`

## Front Backend 
Let's quickly get our front end up and running using  and 
 `cd server`
`nodemon index.js`


### the app will start running
#### You can upload image files along with anotated data. The uploaded data will be stored in mongodb database.
